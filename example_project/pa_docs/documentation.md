# Example Project Documentation

## Introduction
The Example Project is a simple Todo App that allows users to add and manage tasks. It provides a web-based interface where users can input new tasks and view a list of existing tasks.

### Functionality
- User can input new tasks and add them to the task list.
- User can view the list of existing tasks.
- Task data is stored in the browser's LocalStorage.

### Architecture
The Example Project follows a client-side architecture. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and a JavaScript file (`app.js`). The frontend communicates with the browser's LocalStorage API to store and retrieve task data.

### Terminology
- **LocalStorage**: A web storage API that allows web applications to store data in the browser with no expiration date.

## Setting Up the Development Environment
### Prerequisites
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### Environment Setup
1. Clone the project repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Open the project folder in a code editor of your choice.

### Dependencies
There are no external dependencies for this project.

## Codebase Overview
### Repository Access
To access the project code repository, clone the repository using the command `git clone [repository_url]`.

### Directory Structure
- `app.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for the Todo App functionality.
- `index.html`: HTML file that defines the structure and layout of the Todo App.
- `style.css`: CSS file that styles the Todo App's appearance.

### Architecture
The architecture of the Example Project follows a client-side model. The HTML file provides the user interface structure, the CSS file handles the app's styling, and the JavaScript file implements the app's functionality by interacting with the browser's LocalStorage.

## Branching and Merging Strategies
The Example Project follows the Gitflow branching strategy. This means that there are two main branches: `master` and `develop`. Feature branches are created and branched off from the `develop` branch. When a feature is complete, a pull request is created to merge the feature branch back into the `develop` branch. Once the `develop` branch is stable and ready for release, a pull request can be created to merge it into the `master` branch.

## Coding Standards and Conventions
- JavaScript: Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- CSS: Use [BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)](http://getbem.com/) naming convention.
- Indentation: Use 2 spaces for indentation.

## Building the Project
There is no build process required for this project.

## Testing
The Example Project currently does not have any automated tests. Manual testing can be performed by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser and verifying the expected behavior.

## Debugging
- To debug the JavaScript code, you can use the browser's built-in developer tools. Open the browser's developer console to view and debug any JavaScript errors or log statements.

## Deployment
The Example Project can be deployed by hosting the files on a web server or by opening the `index.html` file directly in a web browser.

## API Documentation
N/A

## Database Migrations and Management
The Example Project does not use a database, as it stores task data in the browser's LocalStorage.

## External Integrations
There are no external integrations in the Example Project.

## Security Best Practices
As the Example Project is a simple client-side app, there are no specific security best practices implemented. However, general security practices such as input validation and secure coding practices should be followed.

## Performance Monitoring and Optimization
There is no specific performance monitoring or optimization implemented in the Example Project. However, best practices such as optimizing JavaScript and CSS code, reducing network requests, and optimizing assets should be followed.

## Conclusion
The Example Project provides a simple Todo App that allows users to add and manage tasks. This documentation provides an overview of the project, its setup, and development practices.
