# Example Project Documentation

## Introduction
The example project is a simple Todo App that allows users to add tasks to a list. It is a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides a form where users can enter a task, and the task is added to a list displayed on the page. The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and local storage usage.

## Terminology
- DOM: Document Object Model
- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
- JavaScript: Programming language used for web development
- Form: An HTML element used to collect user input
- Local Storage: A web storage mechanism to store data persistently in the browser

## Setting Up the Development Environment
### Prerequisites
To set up and run the example project, you need the following:
- Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Environment Setup
1. Open the project directory in your chosen IDE or text editor.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to run the app.

### Dependencies
The example project does not have any external dependencies. It uses Materialize CSS and JavaScript libraries, which are loaded from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) in the `index.html` file.

## Codebase Overview
### Repository Access
To access the code repository, clone it using the following command:
```
git clone [repository_url]
```

### Directory Structure
- `app.js`: The main JavaScript file that handles DOM manipulation and local storage operations.
- `index.html`: The HTML file that defines the structure of the app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles for the app.

### Architecture
The example project follows a simple architecture where the HTML file contains the structure of the app, the CSS file provides styles, and the JavaScript file handles the app's functionality. It uses basic DOM manipulation to interact with the HTML elements and store/retrieve data from the browser's local storage.

## Branching and Merging Strategies
The example project follows a simple branching strategy where the `master` branch contains the main codebase. For new features or bug fixes, create a new branch from `master`, make the necessary changes, and submit a pull request to merge the changes back into `master`.

## Coding Standards and Conventions
The example project follows the following coding standards and conventions:
- JavaScript: Use camelCase for variable and function names. Follow a consistent indentation style (e.g., 2 spaces).
- HTML: Use proper indentation and close all tags. Follow naming conventions for class and id attributes.
- CSS: Use classes for styling. Follow a consistent indentation style.

## Building the Project
The example project does not require any build steps. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to run the app.

## Testing
The example project does not have any automated tests. Testing can be done manually by running the app and verifying its functionality.

## Debugging
To debug the example project, you can use the browser's Developer Tools. Use console logging statements to print relevant information and debug potential issues.

## Deployment
The example project can be deployed by hosting the files on a web server or a static hosting service. Simply upload the files to the desired location, and the app will be accessible through the provided URL.

## Conclusion
The example project is a simple Todo App that demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and local storage usage. It provides a starting point for learning web development concepts. For further learning and exploration, refer to the provided resources and documentation in the project's repository.
